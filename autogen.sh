# Convenience script for regenerating all autogeneratable files that are
# omitted from the version control repository. In particular, this script
# also regenerates all aclocal.m4, config.h.in, Makefile.in, configure files
# with new versions of autoconf or automake.
#
# This script requires autoconf-2.65..2.71 and automake-1.16.4 in the PATH.
# It also requires
#   - the gperf program.
